# Projet-Velo-vViz

## INTRODUCTION

This project is carried out by three students of the École Centrale de Lyon during the subject of Data Visualization during the last semester of the university. The components are:

• Chamsedinne
• Salah
• Jon

The general objective of the project is to control the basic knowledge of the Javascript D3 library and create an application with a specific utility using the bases learned during the course.

## VELO'VIZ

The first phase of our project was the choice of data, in our case we went trought a city of Lyon page (https://data.grandlyon.com) where there are several dataset in open source about different elements of the city. Our idea, designed a priori during one of the classes, is that we wanted to use a Google maps and enter information on it and on the other hand we also wanted to enter data in real time.

Finally we chose the dataset of the Lyon bikes which, in addition to containing a lot of information, is updated every minute. This information comes in JSON format and contains more than 360 stations with all the characteristics (address, number of bikes available, neighborhood, identification number, etc ...)

The application therefore aims to serve both the citizen and the city council. The citizen can see the availability of bikes in real time and a prediction for the following hours and the city can draw conclusions from the visually represented history.
